1. Analyze the logical forms of the following statements.

math class.

uncle.

in the dorm will have to be quarantined.

someone who got a D.

(e) $\forall x (D(j) \to D(x))$

D(x) is "x can do it"

j is Jones

3. Analyze the logical forms of the following statements. The universe of
discourse is $\mathbb{R}$. What are the free variables in each statement?

\hspace{12pt}(a) Every number that is larger than $x$ is larger than $y$.

\hspace{12pt}(b) For every number $a$, the equation $ax^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ has at least one
solution iff $a \geq âˆ’2$

\hspace{12pt}(c) All solutions of the inequality $x^3 - 3x < 3$ are smaller than $10$.

\hspace{12pt}(d) If there is a number $x$ such that $x^2 + 5x = w$ and there is a number $y$
such that $4 - y^2 = w$, then $w$ is between -10 and 10.
\vspace{30pt}

(a) $\forall n (n > x \to n > y)$

x and y are free variables.

\vspace{20pt}

(b) $\forall a \exists x (a > 2 \leftrightarrow ax^2 + 4x - 2 = 0)$

no free variables.

\vspace{20pt}

(c) $\forall x (x^3 - 3x < 3 \to x < 10)$
